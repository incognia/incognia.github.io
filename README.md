# Simple Terminal Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jessekernaghan/pen/xwvdBL](https://codepen.io/jessekernaghan/pen/xwvdBL).

A stylized terminal animation using promise chaining to create output. Not sure that was the right direction to go but it appeared there was no other way to get the script to 'pause' as expected in a systematic fashion. Not particularily pleased with the need to .bind each method, and would love to get any feedback on how to create a cleaner technique. I think that ES7's 'await' functionality would really clean it all up.

This is a rough version that will appear in my website rebuild ( whenever it gets done ).
